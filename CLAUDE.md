## Project Structure
Pages are real routes, so each one is exported as its own static HTML file
(readable by crawlers and AI agents).
```
/app
  layout.js            # Root layout: fonts, metadata, JSON-LD, ThemeProvider, SiteShell
  page.jsx             # Home route (Hero, Marquee, Experience, Projects, Skills)
  about|projects|designs/page.jsx   # Routes with per-page metadata
  robots.js, sitemap.js             # Generated at build (force-static)
  llms.txt/route.js    # Markdown summary for LLMs, generated from lib/data.js
  globals.css

/app-pages             # Page bodies (AboutPage, ProjectsPage, DesignsPage)

/components
  SiteShell.jsx        # Persistent shell + useSite() context ({ t, dark, navigate, introDone })
  RoutePages.jsx       # Client bridges for the server route files
  Loader.jsx           # Signature loader — decorative overlay, page is visible underneath
  SmoothScroll.jsx     # Locomotive/Lenis + ScrollTrigger; exports lockScroll()
  HeroShader.jsx       # Three.js aurora (lazy, desktop only, falls back to CSS orbs)
  AgentTools.jsx       # WebMCP tools for AI agents (navigator.modelContext)
  CursorFollower.jsx   # gsap.quickTo cursor (fine pointers only)

## Performance Optimizations
- Reduced loader time from 5.6s → 3.2s
- Lazy loading for images
- CSS-in-JS for component isolation
- Optimized animations with CSS transforms
- Minimal dependencies

## Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev    # Start development server
npm run build  # Build for production
npm start      # Start production server
```

## Recent Updates
1. ✅ Replaced "Full Stack Developer" with "MERN Stack Developer" throughout
2. ✅ Added Swiper.js carousel for Experience section
3. ✅ Implemented custom ThemeToggle with animations
4. ✅ Added social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub) with react-icons
5. ✅ Added contact information (email, phone) in About & Footer
6. ✅ Removed Instagram, FastAPI, Redux from portfolio
7. ✅ Added Helm, Azure DevOps, Bash, Argo CD skills
8. ✅ Optimized loader timing (43% faster)
9. ✅ Updated typewriter to show only 2 roles

## Performance rules
- Run Lighthouse against `npm run build` output (e.g. `npx serve out`), never `next dev` — dev is unminified.
- Keep GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Motion, Three.js and Locomotive out of the initial bundle (dynamic imports via lib/gsap.js, LazyMotion, next/dynamic).
- Never fade large hero text from opacity 0 — it delays LCP. Move it with transforms only.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (or Netlify's `URL`) sets canonical/sitemap/JSON-LD URLs.

## Notes for AI Assistants
- Project uses vanilla CSS, NOT Tailwind (despite having it in skills)
- Skiper UI components require Tailwind, so custom implementations were used
- Theme comes from next-themes; static HTML is always dark until hydration (see SiteShell)
- Skill icons are self-hosted in public/icons/skills (originally from skillicons.dev / devicon / simple-icons)
- Loader timing is critical for UX - keep under 2s; the key `nk-loader-seen` is shared by Loader.jsx and the inline script in layout.js
